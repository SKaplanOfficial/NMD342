# Questions From The Reading
1. How do you organize data in such a way that a user can discover the patterns but is not told/shown exactly what they are?
2. In the context of computers, mainly, why should we prioritize experience of efficiency? I.e. why design to make something good for all users when making it good for a specifically trained user might produce better results?
3. Are there things that should remain passive? What are they, and why should they stay that way?
4. In the cube diagram on page 12, the location of things appears highly subjective. Would you agree with the order of things are presented, or would you change it around? Why?
