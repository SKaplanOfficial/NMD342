Notes on TIGOE's "Physical Computing's Greatest Hits (and misses)"

- Despite themes recurring in physical computing, there are so many ways to express the themes that there is room for originality
- Theremin-like instruments
    - Simple to make but doesn’t address the problem of addressing “meaningful gestures”
- Gloves
    - Drum gloves -> Tapping
        - Natural gesture
    - Many hand gestures, not many as intuitive as tapping
    - Force-sensing resistors on fingertips
- Floor Pads
    - Like DDR
    - Simple to make
    - Not everyone enjoys dancing
- Video Mirrors
    - Simple computer vision
    - “Not much structured interaction”
- Mechanical Pixels
    - Like video mirrors, only physical
    - Still not much structured interaction
    - Expensive
- Scooby-Doo Paintings
    - Interacting painting
    - Need to account for difference between presence and attention
- Body-as-cursor
    - Person’s movement in 3D space correlates to some output
    - General no specific interactions w/ hands or fingers
- Hand-as-cursor
    - Like body-as-cursor, but hand and fingers (sometimes feet) are the focus
    - Relies on control over environment, otherwise detection becomes much more difficult, but still possible
- Multitouch Interfaces
    - Flat surface is not a natural interaction
    - Not necessarily easy/afforable
- Tilty Stands and Tables
    - Physics of an object corresponds to some output
    - Ball in a maze
- Tilty Controllers
    - Tilt of an object corresponds to some output
- Things You Yell At
    - Simple interaction, but very satisfying
    - Pitch detection and voice recognition too intense for micro controller
- Meditation Helpers
    - React to state of mind to help mood
    - Actions based on guesses from various sensor readings
- Fields of Grass
    - Responsive texture
    - Large number of small sensors/actuators
- Remote Hugs
    - Objects paired over network
    - Communicate feeling
- Dolls and Pets
    - Appear and behave anthropomorphically
- LET Fetishism
    - Going overboard with LEDs
- Combinations of themes
