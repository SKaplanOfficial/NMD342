I've really enjoyed NMD342, though I wish I made better use of it. I put effort in, tried to learn how to work with the Arduino, taught myself how to solder, and more, but ultimately I don't think I appreciated the opportunities that this class gave me to explore the ideas I have and the changes I want to see and make in the world. I don't think anyone in the class fully appreciated this.

If I could do it again, I wouldn't let guidelines restrict me from doing something great as I did with the first major assignment. I played by the rules and tried to make a "Happy Feedback Machine" without seeing any reason to do so. I made something that lacked purpose, which is how I thought the project should be, and others could easily see that. Perhaps that's what the project was meant to be. Perhaps not. Either way, I went with my understanding of the project despite not seeing value in what I was creating. But what if I hadn't? What if I had, as Mike would put it, "met the professor half-way"? What would have happened if I had an entirely separate idea and gone with that, incorporating ideas of interaction design while also doing something specifically related to my interests? Sure, my professor could have had objections, but it would be worth the attempt for it would lead to a much better experience (and a much better project).

This class, and perhaps others in New Media, provide you with an environment where adjusting the guidelines so that they work for you is a possibility. In other majors, the guidelines are often inflexible; you have material to learn and that's that. There's very little leeway. But in New Media classes, that's not always the case. If you have an idea, New Media gives you the flexibility to explore and develop that idea into something greater. You just have to me aware that that flexibility exists and willing to take some risks.

In regard to my performance in the class, these realizations are not evidence of failure, but are instead the building blocks of success. This class, and all the challenges presented by it, have made it clear to me that my only limiting factor, ultimately, is me. If I can change that, I possess the ability to ideate and invent separately from filling in guidelines. I can, and should, go above and beyond.
