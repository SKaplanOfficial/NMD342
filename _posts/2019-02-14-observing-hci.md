I'm going to update this post as time goes on, as I think taking the time to observe how people use things equips you with an increasingly useful understanding of how to make actually good designs.

# Printers

For my observation assignment in NMD342, I chose to observe how people interact with the printers in the library.

[Need to make this list into complete thoughts]
- Various types of interactions as there are different attitudes when someone is already in the library and prints something vs. if they uploaded a file earlier and just came to the library to pick it up. The interactions are also affected by the degree to which someone is in a rush.
    - **Not in a rush, in the library:** people are less "aggressive" with the card swipe, some were on their phones while printing, some people chatted with nearby friends, and others waited patiently. Their overall time was slower (~2m), partially because they didn't make an effort to swipe their card and access their file quickly, but it was mainly due to the fact that this group printed more pages. I'm not sure if this would be the same at all times.
    - **In a rush, in the library:** Although I can't confirm whether they were truly in a rush or not, I based this judgement off of whether they immediately left the library after or not. This is definitely not conclusive, but I think it is useful for the observation. The people both in a rush and at the library were about as relaxed as the ones not in a rush, but their end of interaction was much more abrupt. Most grabbed their papers, went to the desk to staple them, and then left. It seemed like they just accepted the fact that the printer will take time, but once it's done they can go back to moving quickly. (~1m)
    - **Not in a rush, not in the library:** Again, this is not conclusive as I based it on the people I was able to see, so someone could come from another part of the library and be counted in this. These people were less patient and more intent on staring at the printer (maybe to make it go faster?) instead of looking at their phones or talking to someone. (~1m)
    - **In a rush, not in the library:** These are people who had just recently come inside (judging by their coat still on, shoes wet, and/or running, speed walking, etc.). They were more agressive with their card swipe and their file selection, they stared at the paper as it printed, and most of them tapped their foot or rushed the printer with hand gestures. Their time varied a lot as some printed a single page and others printed 4 to 8 pages. 
    
- General observations
    - More often than not, people struggled with the card reader. They would try their card in multiple directions before it would work. While the scanner is labelled, I think this comes down to people not having the time to "plan" their card swipe. Since this printer is in a college library, it would be better to have a scanner that doesn't require anything thinking at all, i.e. a vertical one that can scan you card from both sides. I'm not sure how difficult it would be to implement.
    - Some people printed in color when they didn't mean to. This isn't so much an issue with the printer as it a problem with the print from anywhere interface.
    - People often struggled to locate the stapler once their files were done printing. While this isn't a part of the printer, it is part of the process, and is therefore relevant to the user experience. The stapler should probably be on the table right next to the printer. A stationary stapler could work well, that way it wouldn't be misplaced.
