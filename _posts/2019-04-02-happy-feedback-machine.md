# Project #1
For this project, we were tasked with creating a device that would capture a stranger's interest using the concepts of interaction design discussed in class and in the readings. One aspect of this task was to prolong the interaction by rewarding the user with feedback (In other words, by giving them incentive to keep using the device). The design had to be made of durable materials so as to withstand minor abuse, and all wiring had to be hidden.

As much as I would like to say I met all of the expectations, I don't think I did. I tried my best with my limited knowledge of Arduinos to create what I had envisioned, but ultimately my lack of experience stood in the way. Despite this, I would not call the project a failure. If the goal was to learn about interaction design, then this "failure" was far more successful than it would have been if all expectations were easily met.


## The Project
### Description
My idea for this project was to create a set of interactive boxes that a user would discover the connections between as they used the system. Essentially, the idea was to have actions done to one box (such as rotating) directly influence the behavior of another (such as outputting sound, changing light colors, or changing how buttons behaved). Additional behaviors could arise from the combination of multiple boxes â€“ i.e. the distance between two boxes influencing the intensity of light or sound on another box.

Conceptually, this idea was (and still is) relatively simple: once each box is given a unique set of functions, use XBees and/or NFC to establish communication between the boxes, then change/influence the functionality as desired.

### Code
I need to finish commenting the code, but once I do it will be posted on a second GitHub repository for NMD342 projects that has yet to be made. I will update this post once I have done this.
