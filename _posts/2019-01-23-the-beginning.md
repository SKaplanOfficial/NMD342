Notes on Chris Crawford's book.

## Chapter 1
### "What Exactly IS interactivity?"

##### Defining Interactivity
- Overused term
- Most people use to vague of a definition
  - Definitions aren't the end of the story, either. No complex idea can be easily defined.
  
```
Interaction: a cyclic process in which two actors alternately listen, think, and speak
```

- In other words: input, process, and output
- "You can't converse with a brick wall."
- Technically the light in a refrigerator does represent interactivity, but only in a very limited sense. If you call something interactive it should be significantly more complex and worthy of thought.
  - If someone plays with something, is it interactive? Yes, but not to a great degree. -> __Degrees of Interactivity__
  - What's the difference between "High" and "Low" interactivity?
    - Both parties *listening* well -> Understanding each other exactly
    - Both parties *thinking* well -> Equal level of thinking
    - Both parties *speaking* well -> Same language using the same ruleset
    - All three must be done well by both parties. One failure is enough to "botch the entire conversation"
    
    
##### Things That Aren't Interactive
- Printed books - they illicit a reaction, not interaction
  - Plato: words cannot protect or explain themselves
- Dancing - participation - is not interaction
- Movies
- Performance artists *can* interact with their audience, but often don't. "Low" interaction.


##### User Interface
