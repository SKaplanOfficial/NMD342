Notes on Chris Crawford's *The Art of Interactive Design* and Bret Victors "A Brief Rant on the Future of Interaction Design"

## Chapter 1
### "What Exactly IS interactivity?"

#### Defining Interactivity
- Overused term
- Most people use to vague of a definition
  - Definitions aren't the end of the story, either. No complex idea can be easily defined.
  
```
Interaction: a cyclic process in which two actors alternately listen, think, and speak
```

- In other words: input, process, and output
- "You can't converse with a brick wall."
- Technically the light in a refrigerator does represent interactivity, but only in a very limited sense. If you call something interactive it should be significantly more complex and worthy of thought.
  - If someone plays with something, is it interactive? Yes, but not to a great degree. -> __Degrees of Interactivity__
  - What's the difference between "High" and "Low" interactivity?
    - Both parties *listening* well -> Understanding each other exactly
    - Both parties *thinking* well -> Equal level of thinking
    - Both parties *speaking* well -> Same language using the same ruleset
    - All three must be done well by both parties. One failure is enough to "botch the entire conversation"
    
    
#### Things That Aren't Interactive
- Printed books - they illicit a reaction, not interaction
  - Plato: words cannot protect or explain themselves
- Dancing - participation - is not interaction
- Movies
- Performance artists *can* interact with their audience, but often don't. "Low" interaction.


#### User Interface
- Human facts engineering: Increase productivity of industrial workers, emphasison formal experimentation
- Human interface: Extension of human factors, optimizing communication between people and electronic devices
- Interactivity design: take into consideration how the computer thinks when optimizing communication
  - Interactivity design people are usually younger, "Webby" generation
  - Good interactive design incororates form with function
  
  
  
## Chapter 2
### "Why Bother With Interactivity?"

#### New and Revolutionary
- Human-human communication has remained essentially the same since language developed
- Human-computer communication lacks the *understanding* that communication relies on


#### Tried and True
- Living things that interacted for millions of years


#### It's Better
- Engages the human mind more than any other form of expression
- Direction involvement demands greater attention than passive observation
  - "I do and I understand"


#### Basic of Competitive Advantage for Computers
- Since most movies, music, and pinted materials are made using computers, I'm not sure why Crawford thinks software designers can't compete in this space. But I would agree that interactivites designes cannot compete
- Personal computers intrduced the speed necessary for interactivity


#### Unknown Territory
- Revolution in art and computing through hardware and software advances



## Bret Victor - "A Brief Rant on the Future of Interaction Design"
- Microsoft's vision of the future does not improve interactivity
  - "Tools address human needs by amplifying human capabilities", can do -> want to do
  - Hands used for everything, but not tactile response (though we wouldn't be able to know that from the video anyway)
  - "Pictures Under Glass" significantly different from real world interaction, specifically in regard to sliding as the main interaction vs. interacting in 3D space. But is this bad? Is less expressive bad? *How* is it bad?
