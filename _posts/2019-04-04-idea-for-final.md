My idea for a final project is a "vision of the future" installation. In this project, I would be designing an entire experience for users. The goal is to modify a room on campus–if possible–to be as immersive and futuristic as possible. If I cannot get a room on campus to work with, it may be better to just ideate for the rest of the semester and create a detailed explanation of the idea in hopes of sharing that idea in the future.

The main aspect of this is a contextually aware card that communicates with and modifies the world using NFC. This card, in the future, could be your phone, but for the purposes of the project it would just be an NFC card. In the future, anything you interact with would have some sort of communications chip built in that would allow this card to interact with anything. For now, I would only be working with the objects in a small room.

Basically, when you put the card down on something, a projected screen will appear with the content relevant for that object. If you put the card down on a counter, a list of recipes appears. If you put the card down on a coffee table, the TV turns on and a TV guide appears. If you tap the card on the back of a book, information about that book appears on the nearest flat surface. If you put the card down on a bedside table, the lights turn off, calming music plays, and settings for your alarm clock appear.

If you are currently looking at something on a projected screen, you can use your hands to interact with the content, to close the screen, or to resize it. You can also double tap the card on another surface, or touch that surface and tell a voice assistant to “put the display here,” to move the screen to the desired location.

For now, this would all be specifically programmed for these purposes, but in the future it is safe to say that machine learning would be involved to make the interaction as unobtrusive as possible.
