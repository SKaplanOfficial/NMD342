Notes on Don Norman’s “The Design of Everyday Things”

### Chapter 1 - The Psychopathology of Everyday Things

- Push/pull/walking into doors -> Unnecessary troubles
- Design should indicate how to use it without signs
    - Beauty != Utility
- Discoverability and understanding
- Manuals should be unnecessary for simple things


#### The Complexity of Modern Devices
- “Field of design” is relatively new, the act of designing is not
    - Everything in society is design, from household objects to the setup of the government
- Focus on both aesthetics of form and quality of interaction
    - Best case: Enjoyable, usable product
- Industrial design
    - Benefit user and manufacturer
    - Optimize function, value, and appearance
- Interaction design
    - Ensure a positive, enjoyable experience
    - Enhance people’s understand
- Experience design
    - Designing products, products, processes, services, events, and environments
    - Focus on quality and enjoyment of total experience
- Machines are precise, lack emotional depth of people -> difficult to relate human wants and needs to mechanical/computational utilities
- It is the machine designer’s job to understand people
- “We have to accept human behavior the way it is, not the way we would wish it to be”
- Design machines on the assumption that people will make errors


#### Human-Centered Design
- Rapid advancement in technology outpaces improvements in design
- Design improves, but each new industry starts from the beginning
- Human-Centered Design (HCD) as a solution
    - Designs accommodate needs, capabilities, and behavior of humans
- Good-design relies on understanding of psychology & technology
    - Quality communication needed between machine and user
    - Focus on cases where things to wrong as well as when they go right
    - Understanding through observation
    - Not tied to a particular area of study


#### Fundamental Principles of Interaction
- Quality of experience impacts how people interact with a product
- Affordances
    - Refers to the relationship between two things, prosperities of one thing and capabilities of the other determine how the object can be used
    - Anti-affordances - the prevention of interaction
    - Must signify affordances and anti-affordances (without using signs, in the best case)
    - Use the information that people are already accustomed to illicit interaction (i.e. plate on door to signify where to push)
- Signifiers
    - Affordances determine what actions are possible while signifies communicate where the action should take place
    - People grow accustomed to various societal signifiers (though that doesn’t mean the signifiers are good)
    - Perceived affordances need to match actual affordances, unless the intent is to purposely mislead people
- Mapping
    - Relationship between elements of two sets of tings, I.e. lights and light switches
    - Relationship between a controller and its results must be understandable
    - Natural mapping relies on principles of perception
        - It does what it looks like it will do
- Feedback
    - Need some way to affirm that the system is responding to a user’s actions
    - Real life is full of feedback, but mechanical devices are not particularly great at it
    - Must be timely and information
    - Poor feedback can be worse than no feedback at all
    - Too much feedback is also bad
    - Sounds are hard to localize, result in lost time as people angrily turn then off
- Conceptual Models
    - Highly simplified explanation of how something works
    - In this case, “mental models” -> different for each person
    - Signifiers should point people in the direction of one mental model
    - Understand relationship between controls and outcomes
    - Shouldn’t have to do controlled experiments to understand simple settings


#### The System Image
- System image -> Information that can be obtained about an object
- People only enjoy and continue to use things that they can understand


#### The Paradox of Technology
- Basically a call for the Apple Watch


#### The Design Challenge
- Designing a product takes collaboration across many disciplines
- Must satisfying requirements of all disciplines, not from the viewpoint of the designers but of the people who will be using the product
