Notes on Don Norman’s “The Design of Everyday Things”

### Chapter 1 - The Psychopathology of Everyday Things

- Push/pull/walking into doors -> Unnecessary troubles
- Design should indicate how to use it without signs
    - Beauty != Utility
- Discoverability and understanding
- Manuals should be unnecessary for simple things


#### The Complexity of Modern Devices
- “Field of design” is relatively new, the act of designing is not
    - Everything in society is design, from household objects to the setup of the government
- Focus on both aesthetics of form and quality of interaction
    - Best case: Enjoyable, usable product
- Industrial design
    - Benefit user and manufacturer
    - Optimize function, value, and appearance
- Interaction design
    - Ensure a positive, enjoyable experience
    - Enhance people’s understand
- Experience design
    - Designing products, products, processes, services, events, and environments
    - Focus on quality and enjoyment of total experience
- Machines are precise, lack emotional depth of people -> difficult to relate human wants and needs to mechanical/computational utilities
- It is the machine designer’s job to understand people
- “We have to accept human behavior the way it is, not the way we would wish it to be”
- Design machines on the assumption that people will make errors


#### Human-Centered Design
- Rapid advancement in technology outpaces improvements in design
- Design improves, but each new industry starts from the beginning
- Human-Centered Design (HCD) as a solution
    - Designs accommodate needs, capabilities, and behavior of humans
- Good-design relies on understanding of psychology & technology
    - Quality communication needed between machine and user
    - Focus on cases where things to wrong as well as when they go right
    - Understanding through observation
    - Not tied to a particular area of study


#### Fundamental Principles of Interaction
- Quality of experience impacts how people interact with a product
- Affordances
    - Refers to the relationship between two things, prosperities of one thing and capabilities of the other determine how the object can be used
    - Anti-affordances - the prevention of interaction
    - Must signify affordances and anti-affordances (without using signs, in the best case)
    - Use the information that people are already accustomed to illicit interaction (i.e. plate on door to signify where to push)
- Signifiers
    - Affordances determine what actions are possible while signifies communicate where the action should take place
    - People grow accustomed to various societal signifiers (though that doesn’t mean the signifiers are good)
    - Perceived affordances need to match actual affordances, unless the intent is to purposely mislead people
- Mapping
    - Relationship between elements of two sets of tings, I.e. lights and light switches
    - Relationship between a controller and its results must be understandable
    - Natural mapping relies on principles of perception
        - It does what it looks like it will do
- Feedback
    - Need some way to affirm that the system is responding to a user’s actions
    - Real life is full of feedback, but mechanical devices are not particularly great at it
    - Must be timely and information
    - Poor feedback can be worse than no feedback at all
    - Too much feedback is also bad
    - Sounds are hard to localize, result in lost time as people angrily turn then off
- Conceptual Models
    - Highly simplified explanation of how something works
    - In this case, “mental models” -> different for each person
    - Signifiers should point people in the direction of one mental model
    - Understand relationship between controls and outcomes
    - Shouldn’t have to do controlled experiments to understand simple settings


#### The System Image
- System image -> Information that can be obtained about an object
- People only enjoy and continue to use things that they can understand


#### The Paradox of Technology
- Basically a call for the Apple Watch


#### The Design Challenge
- Designing a product takes collaboration across many disciplines
- Must satisfying requirements of all disciplines, not from the viewpoint of the designers but of the people who will be using the product



### Chapter 2 - The Psychology of Everyday Things

- How do people do things?
- What happens when things go wrong?
- How do we detect and rectify problems?


#### How People Do Things: The Gulfs of Execution and Evaluation
- Execution -> Try to figure out how it operates
- Evaluation -> Try to figure out what happened
- Must help people bridge these gulfs
    - Provide information helping people see that they are moving toward or away from their goal
    - Feedback and a quality conceptual model


#### The Seven Stages of Action
- Planning stage -> determining which possible plan of action to follow
- Specification stage -> determine how to enact plan
- Performance stage -> do the action
- Evaluation stage (perceive, interpret, compare)-> interpret results compared to the goal
- Root cause analysis - “Asking why? Until the fundamental cause of the activity is reached”
- Opportunistic actions -> No extensive planning/analysis, do things as opportunities arise


#### Human Thought: Mostly Subconscious
- Human mind is complex, evolved over millions of years
- Mystery: Connection between conscious thoughts and subconscious control of body
- Declarative memory: facts
- Procedural memory: recalling actions
- Cognition begets emotion; emotional begets cognition
    - Cognition attempts to make sense of the world
    - Emotion assigns value
- Subconscious controls skilled behavior
- Extreme emotional states are not good; find balance


#### Human Cognition and Emotion
- Visceral
    - “Lizard brain”
    - Fast response without reason apart from genetic programming
    - Design to illicit positive visceral response
- Behavioral
    - Subconsciously learned skills
    - Control of body is abstracted away from cognitive thought
    - Designers must meet the expectations of the behavioral response, otherwise people are disappointed and/or confused
    - Feedback helps
- Reflective
    - Conscious cognition, develops understanding
    - Slow
    - Memories last longer than immediate reaction
- Design must accommodate all levels


#### The Seven Stages of Action and the Three Levels of Processing
- Balance between level of difficulty and enjoyment


#### People as Storytellers
- People look for causes and results of events
- Conceptual models are a way of expressing cause/effect in terms of objects
    - Such models are often “erroneous”


#### Blaming the Wrong Things
- If two actuals occur in succession, most people reason that the first caused the second
- If an action doesn’t produce a reaction, most people reason that they did not do the action properly
- Underpromise and overdeliver
- Blame is assigned (often incorrectly) on a per-person basis


#### Learned Helplessness
- Repeatedly unable to complete a desired task -> helplessness -> depression


#### Positive Psychology
- Reframing “failure” into challenges and learning experience
- “Fail often, fail fast”
- Provide help/guidance and a way to resume work flow


#### Falsely Blaming Yourself
- “The idea that a person is at fault when something goes wrong is deeply entrenched in society”
- Blaming the person does not fix the cause of the problem


#### How Technology Can Accommodate Human Behavior
- As technology advances and costs go down, more can be done to put humans first
- Example: Nest Thermostat


#### Seven Fundamental Design Principles
1. What do I want to accomplish?
2. What are the alternative action sequences?
3. Now what can I do?
4. How?
5. What happened?
6. Meaning?
7. Is this okay? Goal accomplished?
- Feedforward: Adjustment of a process using anticipated results
- Don’t criticize unless you can do better



Notes on Don Norman’s “Emotional Design”

### Chapter 1 - Attractive Things Work Better

- Studies show that attractive interfaces are viewed as easier to use
- Emotions change how the human mind approaches and ultimately solves problems
- Good mood -> Creativity -> Problem solving
- Attractiveness makes people perceive the problem as simpler
- Cognitive -> Assign meaning
- Affective -> Value
- Humans are able to overcome their biological heritage (sometimes, i.e. fear of heights)
